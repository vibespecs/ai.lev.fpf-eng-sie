## APP-SIE-01 - AP242 and QIF product-lifecycle query {#app-sie-01-ap242-and-qif-product-lifecycle-query}

A quality engineer asks: “For released product-definition revision and configuration `R`, which QIF inspection plan and result concern feature `F` at effectivity `E`?” The AP242 and QIF sources use different models and identifiers. SIE may connect their qualified claims; Systems Engineering and authorized quality Work retain configuration, release, applicability, and acceptance decisions.

The application uses the repertoire as follows:

| Contribution | Constructed application result |
| --- | --- |
| `SIE.1` | The constructed contract in SIE.1:5 names the engineer, workflow, answer columns and effectivity. It supplies the 24-hour QIF observation window and two-second response limit and permits qualified evidence with separately visible unresolved local-extension and unknown-unit branches. Authority, negative cases and stops remain explicit. |
| `SIE.2` | A source inventory records AP242:2025 edition 4 at stage 90.92, “to be revised”, the applicable QIF edition, source models, identifiers, configuration/effectivity meanings, owners, and unresolved local extensions. |
| `SIE.3`, when needed | Qualify an existing model, or extend it to distinguish an inspection requirement from an observation of the applicable configured feature. The plan and an observation of another configuration provide counterexamples. |
| `SIE.4` | Correspondence rows distinguish product feature, inspection characteristic, plan applicability, configuration, and result relations; unsupported equivalence and incompatible-feature rows remain explicit. |
| `SIE.5` | Feature and characteristic identities are disposed at the required revision, configuration, and effectivity grain; source identifiers and issuers remain visible. |
| `SIE.6` | AP242 definition/effectivity claims and QIF plan/result claims are composed with source, interval, authority, and conflict branches preserved. |
| `SIE.7` | Executable rules select the released configuration, map accepted endpoint relations, preserve identifiers, reject unsupported joins, and trace every output row to its premises. |
| `SIE.8` | A virtual or hybrid realization is selected against freshness, access, latency, provenance, and recovery rather than because a graph store is preferred. |
| `SIE.9` | The receiving interface returns matched, unmatched, incompatible, stale, and source-error branches with their interpretations and provenance. |
| `SIE.10` | Layered tests cover carrier/schema, source semantics, correspondence, identity/effectivity, composition, transformations, provenance/currentness, quality, and the representative query. SIE.10:5.1 applies the stated freshness, response and partial-answer criteria while keeping excluded branches visible. |

The constructed package returns the contract-permitted qualified row set, with unmatched or incompatible results and the unresolved local-extension and unknown-unit branches visible separately. It stops if configuration/effectivity or feature identity is unresolved, a load-bearing source edition cannot be qualified, a conflict is hidden, or the receiving query fails. It supplies evidence to the applicable `SYSE.7`, `SYSE.13`, `SYSE.14`, or quality owner; it does not choose the released revision or accept the inspection result.

## APP-SIE-02 - Semiconductor identity and traceability {#app-sie-02-semiconductor-identity-and-traceability}

A recall-triage query crosses SEMI device/substrate identifiers, GS1 events, supplier identifiers, and enterprise master data. The package preserves wafer, die, device, package, lot, and event grains. `SIE.5` records same, different, part, version, variant, alternate, or unresolved dispositions with each scheme and issuer. `SIE.6` retains event time, source authority, contradictory events, and absent links. `SIE.10` tests positive, reused-identifier, split/merge, contradictory-event, and missing-link cases.

The interface can return a bounded trace, unresolved branch, or prohibited-disclosure stop. MDM and domain stewards retain authoritative identity and value decisions; quality, safety, and recall authorities retain action.

## APP-SIE-03 - End-to-end quality and provenance {#app-sie-03-end-to-end-quality-and-provenance}

A data pipeline is syntactically healthy, yet an analytic may be unsafe because a source version is stale, a unit conversion is wrong, a default hides absence, a mapping omits one category, or derivation is missing. The contract selects only quality dimensions and thresholds that can change this use. The source manifest and mapping specification expose versions, units, defaults, error branches, and provenance. The claim composition keeps governed inputs and contradictions visible. Validation can return a usable subset, an explicit failure, or an unresolved measurement need.

A mapping that returns 1 millimetre for an input of 1 metre fails the required conversion to 1000 millimetres. That probe can finish a bounded failure; unrelated layers remain unexamined. Conversely, an unchanged JSON field can carry a new future-horizon meaning while the receiver still reads “available now”. Its structural pass cannot preserve the earlier use claim.

For a positive whole-use or permitted subset result, SIE.10 covers every load-bearing premise, including receiving interpretation, with new or matching earlier evidence. Pipeline defects return to Data Engineering, mapping defects to SIE.7, and source defects to their owners. A quality vocabulary or process certificate cannot supply missing evidence for the receiving claim.

## APP-SIE-04 - High-change provider availability without a materialized graph {#app-sie-04-high-change-provider-availability-without-a}

Two providers expose current availability through governed APIs. One field means “on hand”; the other means “available to promise”. Neither permits replication. The contract requires a purchasing comparison with timestamps and explicit incomplete results. `SIE.4` keeps the meanings distinct and accepts only narrower qualified relations. `SIE.6` composes rows where supported and returns non-comparability otherwise. `SIE.8` excludes copying from the providers' existing prohibition, then selects query-time virtual mappings subject to the receiving latency, trace, and failure conditions. The excluded copying alternative needs no implementation, recovery, or exit design. The interface exposes timeouts, source errors, timestamps, and incompatible rows.

SIE.3 can finish by reusing a model that distinguishes the two quantities, their attribution, unit, time, and horizon. If a provider later changes its promise horizon, SIE.11 finds which mappings and receiving interpretations depend on that meaning; unaffected product descriptions can retain their qualification. The purchasing application decides what to do with incomplete or non-comparable results.

## APP-SIE-05 - A Modular Equipment-Classification Commons {#app-sie-05-a-modular-equipment-classification-commons}

Two manufacturers and a service partner share equipment classes to interpret service observations. Local modules retain product-specific distinctions; qualified correspondences state how they relate to the shared core. SIE.12 identifies the actual users, module scope, dependencies, content and release rights, and contact.

A proposal changes a shared class's criterion from equipment with a replaceable drive to equipment serviced through a replaceable drive module. Examples show which equipment changes classification. The authorized maintainers decide the shared content; the community's identification rules keep the earlier and replacement meanings recoverable. In the worked disposition, the earlier `equip:DriveReplaceable` class keeps its meaning and the new `equip:DriveModuleServiceable` class receives a distinct identifier. SIE.11 follows the change to affected service queries and local correspondences. The service partner's module-planning query adopts the new class: equipment X with only a separately replaceable drive is excluded, while equipment Y with the supported drive-module service arrangement is included. Manufacturer A retains its spare-drive query and matching evidence under the earlier class. The identified release keeps both meanings recoverable and supplies the migration and notice those users need; these two results do not establish every user's migration.

The contact communicates and routes questions. Source owners retain their product descriptions; consumers decide whether a module edition supports their use. Incompatible local criteria can remain in scoped modules with supported correspondences. A pair that needs only one availability interface can finish its model and interface agreement without creating this commons.
